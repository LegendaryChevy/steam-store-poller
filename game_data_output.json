You will have to explore each room, look for elements that help you to continue advancing throughout the game and unlock new areas, but the further you go, more dangerous it will be, you must pay close attention in the area, identify each entity and know how to avoid them if you want to survive. <br>Look for supplies, store them in your inventory, explore all the rooms, solve puzzles, unlock areas of the map, interact, try to collect everything you find.<br>The main objective of <i>Inside the Backrooms</i> is to engage players with its gameplay, difficulty and atmosphere. There are countless identical rooms with an old, dirty carpet and pale yellowish walls, where at first glance it gives you a gloomy and bad feeling where you realize that it is not a safe place.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>LEVELS</strong></h2>The game currently has 5 levels, each level is huge and is designed to be more difficult than the previous one and each one with different puzzles and mechanics.<br><br>There are also 2 secret mini levels that will lead you to a secret ending..<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1987080/extras/LEVELS_POOL_GIF.gif?t=1695935945\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>VIRTUAL REALITY</strong></h2>The game is compatible with VR for those who want to live the most terrifying experience in the backrooms, If you have an Oculus Quest device you can't miss the experience of being trapped in the backrooms in virtual reality.<br><br><br><i><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> At the moment, VR support is still very poor and you will likely run into issues regarding controls, comfort and compatability.
