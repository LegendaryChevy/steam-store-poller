Despite some parts of the city being in disrepair, the cathedral had been well-maintained and left a strong impression on the new rulers. Changes included the removal of Christian elements like the bells and altar, and the addition of Islamic features such as a minbar, four minarets, and a mihrab. From its conversion until the completion of the Blue Mosque in 1616, Hagia Sophia was Istanbul's principal mosque.\n\nPerfect for a family-friendly adventure, this VR experience at our caf\u00e9 combines education, history, and fun in a captivating journey through time."}}}, "1629060": {"1629060": {"success": true, "data": {"name": "Colibri XR Immersive Art Gallery", "steam_appid": 1629060, "required_age": 0, "is_free": false, "detailed_description": "<strong>Colibri XR immersive art gallery</strong> is\u00a0dedicated to promoting compassion, growing empathy, caring and kindness through virtual reality art.\u00a0It is the room to listen to the stories told by drawings, soak into creative energy all around you, explore like children with their crayons, feel the joy of colours, tap into the power of feelings and emotions, fill the space with soul warming creations ... experience art with purpose.<br><br><strong>Part 1 &quot;Estrella.

She wanted to possess a cloud, to have one for herself. But clouds float and travel in the sky, and they are always changing their form. Sometimes they look like an overcoat, sometimes like a horse. Because of the nature of impermanence within the clouds, the River suffered very much. Her pleasure, her joy had become just chasing after clouds, one after another, but despair, anger, and hatred became her life. Then one day a strong wind came and blew away all the clouds in the sky. The sky became completely empty.... That night was the first opportunity for her to hear her own crying, the sounds of water crashing against the banks of the River. Because she was able to listen to her own voice, she discovered something quite important. She realized that what she had been looking for was already in herself. She found out that clouds are nothing but water. Clouds are born from water and will return to water. And she found out she herself was also water... When she opened her heart completely to the evening sky she received the image of the full Moon - beautiful, round, like a jewel within herself... The fresh and beautiful Moon is traveling in the utmost empty sky. When the mind-rivers of living beings are free, that image of the beautiful Moon will reflect in each of us.

compassion, empathy, and creativity. Immerse yourself in a world of vibrant art and heartwarming stories, perfect for families and children to explore together.\n\n**Part 1: \"Estrella. The Gift\"**\nJoin Estrella on a magical journey inspired by ancient Inca traditions and the mystical world of the Qero shamans. As she searches for the legendary star of gold, she encounters powerful spirit animals like Serpents, Jaguars, Pumas, Hummingbirds, Eagles, and Condors. These guides lead her through extraordinary locations, helping her overcome fears and discover her innate talents. With courage and curiosity, Estrella learns that the true treasure lies within her.\n\n**Part 2: \"The River and The Clouds\"**\nInspired by the teachings of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, this illustrated poem tells the story of a River chasing ever-changing clouds. Through this journey, she learns the beauty of impermanence and discovers that everything she sought was always within her. The River finds peace and harmony, reflecting the serene image of the Moon in her waters.\n\n**Part 3: \"Pebble Meditation\"**\nAlso inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh, this part guides you through a calming meditation. Breathe in and see yourself as a flower, a mountain, still water, and space. Each breath helps you feel fresh, solid, reflective, and free.\n\nBring your family to Colibri XR and explore these profound and beautiful stories together, experiencing art with a purpose in a fun and engaging VR setting."}}}, "1629480": {"1629480": {"success": true, "data": {"name": "The Last Dance Saloon", "steam_appid": 1629480, "required_age": 0, "is_free": false, "detailed_description": "Bounty hunters are after you. <i>Again.</i><br><br><strong><i>The Last Dance Saloon</i></strong> is a gun-toting, time-looping, rhythm-based shootout at the edge of the known universe.

connections between anti-equality lobbyists, senior Australian politicians, and international organizations. Unlike traditional documentaries, this experience allows you to independently explore the issues and form your own conclusions.\n\nHost Michela Ledwidge, a queer trans woman, was inspired to create this documentary after witnessing the emotional impact of the Safe Schools debate in 2016. She aims to uncover the complex relationships and motivations behind anti-LGBTQI messaging in Australia. \n\nUsing the Australian Christian Lobby as a starting point, Michela explores the data and unravels the financial and political threads that influence LGBTQI politics. The documentary invites you to understand the motivations behind these groups and the impact of echo chambers on our society.\n\nFor those who don't have access to VR equipment, or want to share the experience with friends, more information is available through a podcast on Soundcloud. Join the conversation and uncover the hidden influences shaping some of Australia's most polarizing issues.\n\n**Find out more and connect with us on Twitter!**"}}}, "1627670": {"1627670": {"success": true, "data": {"name": "A Clever Label Playtest", "steam_appid": 1627670, "required_age": 0, "is_free": false, "detailed_description": "", "about_the_game": "", "short_description": "", "header_image": "https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1627670/header.jpg?t=1627273977", "website": null, "pc_requirements": [], "publishers": [""], "platforms": {"windows": true, "mac": false, "linux": false}, "categories": [{"id": 54, "description": "VR Only"}], "release_date": {"coming_soon": false, "date": "25 Jul, 2021"}, "support_info": {"url": "", "email": ""}, "background": "", "background_raw": "", "content_descriptors": {"ids": [], "notes": null}, "ratings": null, "url": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627670/", "ai_description": "Title: \"Mystic Maze Adventure\"\n\nDescription: Dive into the enchanting world of \"Mystic Maze Adventure,\" a delightful and family-friendly VR game perfect for a cafe setting!
