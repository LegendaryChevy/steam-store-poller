Once upon a time there reigned a noble Lord loved and revered by his subjects. In his pursuit of wealth and safety, the Lord pressed upon the forest dwellers who called the thicket their home.

As years flowed like a river, the kingdom flourished, and the Lord's legacy continued through his two heirs. In a world where tradition dictated that the elder son ascend the throne, the younger one's heart seethed with jealousy that painted his thoughts a shade of darkness. In a moment when the old Lord breathed his last, his elder son found himself framed. His left hand was severed from his body by the very sibling he once called kin. The pain of betrayal and his father's death propelled him into a desperate escape, and he vanished deep into the woods.<br>In the heart of those enchanted woods, where ancient secrets were whispered through the rustling leaves, the elder son encountered the Wild Spirit \u2013 a sentinel of the land, as old as the forest itself.
