In mid-nineties northeast China, Jin Xuezhe is drawn to the slow-moving exercises of the Buddhist Falun Gong discipline, whose early morning meditators fill the parks of his hometown, Changchun. When the communist regime bans the popular practice in 1999, Jin is unwilling to sit by as disinformation in the state media maligns his faith and community. Tragically, however, speaking out against the growing propaganda and disappearances brings the risk of arrest, and worse. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2689630/extras/esvr-steam-assets-04.png?t=1709671332\" /><br><br>This 12-minute interactive documentary combines live-action video and original recorded testimony with animated recreations brought to life from the drawings of acclaimed comic book artist Daxiong (Star Wars, Justice League), who, like Jin, was forced to flee Changchun to escape persecution. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2689630/extras/ESVRGIF4.gif?t=1709671332\" /><br><br>This interactive VR film features a custom soundscape to trigger haptic sensations delivered through the new Woojer Vest (optional), which heightens the experience as cops arrest you on the street for handing out leaflets, and you get to feel the heart-pounding tension of a police interrogation in China. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2689630/extras/ESVRGIF5.gif?t=1709671332\" /><br><br>ETERNAL SPRING (\u9577\u6625) VR works as a standalone experience, while also adding a new dimension to the animated documentary feature ETERNAL SPRING (\u9577\u6625), which was Canada\u2019s official submission to the 2023 Academy Awards\u00ae for Best International Feature Film.
